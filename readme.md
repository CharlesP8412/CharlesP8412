I have recently started on the path of becoming a full stack developer and programming in general and my only regret is that I did not start sooner. I've always enjoyed being a DIY type of person and now that I've started my journey of coding I am excited to think of what I can build and create.

With 8 years of experience as a military communications specialist (including server and network administration) along wiht 7 years experience in operations; I have developed a keen enjoyment of finding solutions to problems.  Whether it is building computer networks or servers, deploying radio systems in a helicopter for the first time, or researching laws and regulations to develop range polices.

With an 'I can do that...' attitude and constant desire to learn, I can't wait to see what comes next.
