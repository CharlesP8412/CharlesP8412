### Hi, I'm Chuck, a full stack developer with a background in IT.

### [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/charles-prystupa/) | [CPrystupa.com](https://CPrystupa.com)

Since I started coding, I don't think I will be able to stop. Previously my approach with technology was "there has got to be a program or device out there" that I can find and can solve the problem I was facing.

Now I can build a solution myself.
 
Outside of coding I still enjoy playing in my home lab, tinkering with networks and my servers to stay current, and just to see what I can do.

If you have any questions about my projects or just want to discuss tech, feel free to add me on LinkedIn or message me.
