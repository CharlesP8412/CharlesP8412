### Hi, I'm Chuck, a full stack developer with a background in IT.

Since I started coding, I don't think I will be able to stop. Previously my approach with technology was "there has got to be a program or device out there" that I can implement and can solve the problem I was facing.

 Now I get to apply my DIY attitude and build one myself.
 
Outside of coding I still enjoy playing in my home lab, tinkering with networks and my servers to stay current, and just to see what I can do.
I like learning as much as I can however right now I am focusing on learning **C#**


If you have any questions about my projects or just want to discuss tech, feel free to add me on LinkedIn or message me.
